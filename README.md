# barbieQ

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of barbieQ is to analyse barcode count data generated from cell
clonal tracking (i.e., lineage tracing) experiments, supporting barcode
count data preprocessing, statistical testing, and visualization.

## Installation

You can install the development version of barbieQ like so:

``` r
BiocManager::install("Oshlack/barbieQ")
```

## Getting started

Once installed the best place to get started is the vignette. For most
users the most convenient way to access this is online
[here](https://github.com/Oshlack/barbieQ/blob/main/vignettes/barbieQ/inst/doc/barbieQ.html).

Alternatively, if you choose to build the vignette, you can load
barbieQ, then browse the vignettes:

``` r
library(barbieQ)
browseVignettes("barbieQ")
```

## Citing barbieQ

We are currently writing a paper to introduce the methods implemented in
barbieQ. We will update this part once it’s available.
