<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of barbieQ is to analyse barcode count data generated from cell clonal tracking (i.e., lineage tracing) experiments, supporting barcode count data preprocessing, statistical testing, and visualization.

## Installation

You can install the development version of barbieQ from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Oshlack/barbieQ")
```

Alternatively, you can install the stable version of barbieQ from BioConductor:

``` r
BiocManager::install("barbieQ")
```

## Getting started

Once installed the best place to get started is the vignette. For most users the most convenient way to access this is online [here](https://github.com/Oshlack/barbieQ/blob/main/vignettes/barbieQ/inst/doc/barbieQ.html). 

Alternatively, if you choose to build the vignette, you can load barbieQ, then browse the vignettes:

``` r
library(barbieQ)
browseVignettes("barbieQ")
```

## Citing barbieQ
